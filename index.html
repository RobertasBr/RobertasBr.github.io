            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it's the language that web pages are written in.
                <br><br>
                Imagine a web page as a big book with lots of pages, pictures, and words. HTML is like the blueprint for that book, telling the computer how to display everything on the page.
                <br><br>
                HTML is made up of special "tags" that surround different parts of the content, like text or images. For example, a tag might tell the computer to make a piece of text bold, or to display an image in a certain place on the page.
                <br><br>
                So, when you use a web browser to look at a web page, the browser reads the HTML code and uses it to display everything on the page in the right way. Without HTML, web pages wouldn't exist!
                </p>
            <a href="page3.html"><h3>CSS</h3></a>
            <div id="cssid">
                <a href="./page3.html"><img src="./css.png" alt="css"></a>
            </div>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's another language that web developers use to make web pages look nice and organized.
                <br><br>
                Think of a web page like a painting. HTML provides the basic structure and content of the painting, but CSS adds color, texture, and style to it. It's like the paint and brushes that an artist uses to create a masterpiece.
                <br><br>
                CSS works by targeting specific elements in the HTML code, like a paragraph or a heading, and then applying certain styles to them. Styles can include things like changing the font size, color, or typeface, as well as adjusting the layout and positioning of elements on the page.
                <br><br>
                So when you see a web page with a really nice design, with fancy fonts, colors, and images that all work together, that's all thanks to CSS! It makes the web page look more attractive and appealing to the eye.</p>
